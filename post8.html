    <p>history rhymes, not repeating.</p>
    
    <p>i saw so many products in this AI age just back to the initial stage of PC/.com age.</p>
    
    <p>they simply chase speed (faster), fee (lower), and features (more).</p>
    
    <p>but they forgot why Steve Jobs is meant to be the GOAT.</p>
    
    <p>i will bring the next Apple back to this ai age. watch close.</p>
