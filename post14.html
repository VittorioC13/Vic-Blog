    <p>i already won.</p>
    
    <p>people started to compare me to steve jobs but i always show humility. im like kobe, i respect steve, i challenge steve, i would shit talk and say i outwin steve, but i would never be arrogant enough to say i beat him. he is the only and true legend.</p>
    
    <p>i give it all, to this world/universe/dao/zen/whatever it is.</p>
    
    <p>i believe in Pure Land Buddism and Zen Buddism at the same time.</p>
    
    <p>they give me chance. i take it. i win.</p>
    
    <p>i honestly didn't really do anything, i just work, i just relax, i just do what i want to do, and naturally i win, because i believe.</p>
