    <h1 class="post-title">Why I Love to Build?</h1>
    
    <p>The reason why I love building is because she's my own baby and I can play with her and dress her perfect.</p>
    
    <p>This AI age makes everything way too fast and standardized for what is 'ai-aesthetics' (which appeared to be pure white and black/purple and blue/functional and minimal, if you can understand what I mean).</p>
    
    <p>I made my product to just look fun to use. But when you actually use it, it's seriously focusing on 1 little awkwardly small niche extremely.</p>
    
    <p>I also wanna create a 'story' when using my product. You can just think however utilitarian and find my product perfectly meet your utilitarianism. You can also think however childish and find my product perfectly meet your (and my) childish nature.</p>
    
    <p>I also read Dao De Jing written by Lao Tzu, it was an accident that I sneaked into the book store and wanna read @sama's biography for free. But I just saw Dao De Jing aside and I think its wisdom will change how I personally am and how my product can stand different than other competitors who only cares about 'data'.</p>
    
    <p>I believe focusing on everywhere users can't even notice is massively important. Which most startups are too fast to notice.</p>
    
    <p>I kept on telling myself what Mike Markkula told Steve Jobs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Empathy</li>
      <li>Focus</li>
      <li>Impute</li>
    </ol>
