    <p>as i continue to read, feel, think Zen.</p>
    
    <p>i found commonality between startup and Zen.</p>
    
    <p>1)</p>
    
    <p>imagine Zen as an exam.</p>
    
    <p>even if you are handed the exact answer, you still can't enlighten.</p>
    
    <p>so do startups.</p>
    
    <p>even if we have millions of successful founder stories and advice</p>
    
    <p>you still can't win until you really work on your own path.</p>
    
    <p>2)</p>
    
    <p>Zen is not about shaving head and become monks.</p>
    
    <p>Zen is about contemplate while you are.</p>
    
    <p>you can get infinite inspiration through life</p>
    
    <p>and in one moment you will be enlightened and enter the zone.</p>
    
    <p>so do startups.</p>
    
    <p>you can't just always iterate iterate iterate.</p>
    
    <p>you gotta step outside and really live a life.</p>
    
    <p>and then some part of life will sharpen your intuition and makes you unstoppable.</p>
