    <h1 class="post-title">why i build Velowen?</h1>
    
    <p>what if i experience the best things in this world, practice zen buddism, enlightened, butterfly, beauty, everything.</p>
    
    <p>and focus them into one point and make a product.</p>
    
    <p>because i believe fundamentally all human beings are buddha or god.</p>
    
    <p>you are already free and optimal, but you just lock yourself in the cage/matrix (simple example would be "i work hard for money for freedom", but you born as freedom why u need to first need money and second work hard and third might destroy your body)</p>
    
    <p>someone enlightened because they smell flower and they found out the scent means the "spring" is inside of flowers, not outside. so that means the real buddha and soul is inside of you, never outside. if i can make a xr glasses that may enlighten more people, that would be fun!</p>
    
    <p>so i want to make a product surpassing just five senses, but make it intuition-based and use XR to start with. and i want everyone to enlighten and instantly become god and buddha and be free and happy.</p>
    
    <p>so, up to this point i dont care if im that person who make it, or i dont treat other people doing same stuff as competitors. i treat everyone as "contributors". so if i dont give a shit whether im gonna make that true, then i am completely free and would not be restricted by any laws and startup convention and all that!</p>
    
    <p>this is the point of Velowen</p>
