    <p>in Dao De Jing by Lao Tzu - chapter 7</p>
    
    <p>the world is oftentimes work reversely.</p>
    
    <p>what you give attention the most often will be the first ditched by the world.</p>
    
    <p>以其不自生，故能长生</p>
    
    <p>it means you need to build without thinking about self-interest to really gain personal success and longevity and sustainability.</p>
    
    <p>...后其身而身先，外其身而身存</p>
    
    <p>it alerts this AI age, that only if you don't chase to be "First Mover", you will be the first mover. only if you don't crave to stay, you actually stay.</p>
