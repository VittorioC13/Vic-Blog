    <h1 class="post-title">Lao Tzu's startup lesson - 1</h1>
    
    <p>in chapter 5 of Dao De Jing by Lao Tzu, college is effectively negated.</p>
    
    <p>多言数穷，不如守中</p>
    
    <p>it means the more you study the less you can do about life. he would rather keep the inner peace in his mind.</p>
    
    <p>i believe it is universally true. the more your wanna be prepared and started to absorb "knowledge", the less time you are actually executing and doing stuff, thus the less intuition could be trained in specific endeavor.</p>
    
    <p>intuition is a crazy weapon that only can be learned through real fights. you never learn how to play basketball in youtube but you actually shoot and find that feeling.</p>
    
    <p>same applied to startup. stop watching yc michael & dalton podcasts over and over again. do more, study less, you will learn more.</p>
