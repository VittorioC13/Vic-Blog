  <h1>Third Post</h1>
  <p>This is my third blog post! I'm getting the hang of this blogging thing.</p>
  
  <p>Today I want to share some thoughts about web development and how simple it can be to create something beautiful.</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones. A clean HTML file with some CSS can create a beautiful, fast-loading website.</p>
  
  <p>What do you think? Have you tried building something simple lately?</p>
