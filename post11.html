    <p>why children are always innovative?</p>
    
    <p>why children are always curious?</p>
    
    <p>why children can see things we can't?</p>
    
    <p>why children are free and happy?</p>
    
    <p>because they are empty.</p>
    
    <p>God always see room inside children.</p>
    
    <p>they don't plan nothing for the future.</p>
    
    <p>they don't strategize their life.</p>
    
    <p>they leave the room completely for God's plan.</p>
    
    <p>it all comes from being 'empty'.</p>
    
    <p>the greatest of all time never know themselves will be.</p>
    
    <p>they just follow god's plan.</p>
