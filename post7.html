    <p>it's so funny to be a nobody.</p>
    
    <p>right now, Oct 20, 2025. Victor Che is nobody. no one knows this name is tech circle, no one will invest in him, no one believes him that he is destined to be the next Steve Jobs.</p>
    
    <p>but within 5-10 years. i will be somebody. it's just so apparent to myself. i just know.</p>
    
    <p>the history is always rhyming (may not technically be repeating). Steve Jobs back in days also was a nobody. but even after millions of stories of people actually turn from no one to someone, others still don't believe the potential of young builders.</p>
    
    <p>i believe in myself. i bet on myself. i build; i talk to customers; i have intuition; i will be great.</p>
