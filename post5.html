    <p>what i wanna do is not DESTROY investment banking using AI.</p>
    
    <p>i wanna CLEAN UP the seeds of analysts, and make them better clear thinkers who cannot be replaced by any intelligence.</p>
    
    <p>i believe the 80-100 hour grind of banking will be killed by AI, which is good.</p>
    
    <p>but the clear thinkers in finance who almost saved everyone in 2008 should be brought again.</p>
