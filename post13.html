    <h1 class="post-title">why i hate current tech circle</h1>
    
    <p>it's good that people started to realize taste matters.</p>
    
    <p>but how dedicated they really are?</p>
    
    <p>i see zero efforts made.</p>
    
    <p>the current tech circle are all wrong, with none due respect.</p>
    
    <p>people still chase status by the amount raised and who they know.</p>
    
    <p>people still believe speed above all else.</p>
    
    <p>let me get this straight.</p>
    
    <p>you will never win, if you believe what everyone is believing.</p>
