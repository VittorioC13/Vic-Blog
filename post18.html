    <h1 class="post-title">im way too naive</h1>
    
    <p>i constantly fight with my inner self on one very specific point - to what extend should i be an idealist?</p>
    
    <p>3 months ago i would say: just pick an extreme and never stop til you die.</p>
    
    <p>2 months ago i would say: be an idealist.</p>
    
    <p>1 month ago i would say: there's a very subtle balance...</p>
    
    <p>but now, i started to fight again. i clearly know - with all due respect - that be and only be an idealist basically means you are escaping the harsh reality and choose to put yourself high up to gain low-hanging-fruit dignity. but if i choose to go on a complete rational, data-backed, pragmatic (not in american pragmatist sense like william james) way then i would never realize my dream.</p>
    
    <p>so i choose to find someone who can actually respect my taste but can drag me back simultaneously.</p>
    
    <p>this dude is a much better CEO than i do.</p>
    
    <p>i would not say anything before any fruits settle. but i expect and allow anything slides by my trajectory.</p>
