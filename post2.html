    <h1 class="post-title">Startup Marketing in my eyes</h1>
    
    <p>i still think marketing should be about core values. just like what Steve brought us "if every greatness has a computer, that would be Apple computer."</p>
    
    <p>we still should honor the greatness, we still should "impute" a feeling to our customers through the traditional distribution strategy.</p>
    
    <p>i believe startup should do it even more.</p>
    
    <p>this world is full of noises and adhds and we will never have a chance to be remembered after flood of bots and crazy information flow. the only cure is IMPUTING.</p>
    
    <p>impute means to tuck your value into customer's brain.</p>
    
    <p>i would happily argue that all startups should focus not on the speed and fees, not on the communities, not on the cinematic demo launch,</p>
    
    <p>but truly on the value, the honor, the greatness.</p>
